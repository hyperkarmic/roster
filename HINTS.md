# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. **The ultimate TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) of this homework is that you need to implement a program that generates a website that you can view the hierarchy of a company. It generates it through a series of questions where it asks you about your employees**.

1. There's a big focus on classes in this homework, ensure that you're using a class for each of the one's mentioned in the README.

1. We're provided with tests, these seem to map with each of the classes given to us, probably good to get these passing right? If `npm run test` isn't working, then you probably need to run `npm install` to ensure you've got the _Jest_ package.

1. There's a lot going on in the homework so lets recap:

   - Classes are required
   - Tests will test the classes we create
   - HTML will be generated to represent the classes
     > This is given to you already
   - The `{{ team }}` syntax you can see in the `main.html` file is a way of saying hey, find me this syntax: `{{ something }}` and replace it with whatever I've got such as `<p>Hello</p>`.
     > You'll see this syntax used soon by a library called 'HandleBars' take it on face value for now.

1. We're getting an explanation of exactly what each specific role such as 'Engineer' should have that is separate from 'Employee'.

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo and a video of your application working!

   > Check for sneaky console errors and leftover console logs!

1. All the tests must pass!

1. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

1. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots **and a github video of your application working!**

   - To do this there's lots of screen capture software available however the standard operating system should work fine:

     1. Mac OS: You should be able to use QuickTime player to screen record.
     1. Windows: You should be able to use a built in Screen Recorder as part of the Windows Game Bar, https://betanews.com/2019/01/14/windows-10-screen-recorder-ultility/

     > If neither of these work then a safe bet is to look at OBS but the UI can be a bit clunky at first :thumbsup:

   - Probably easiest to leave this video in Google Drive and keep it out of Git, especially if it's a massive file!

1. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

1. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
