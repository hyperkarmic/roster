 # Team Member Generator (Homework week 10)
 ## Description
 This project uses inquirer to ask questions about team members, who are then rendered, using classes, to HTML, giving a full guide to all members of a coding team!

Initially, questions are asked to create an instance of a manager.  These questions, and the manager function were the first functionality to be implemented.  Then I implemented a menu, which connected to creator functions for ‘interns’ and employees, allowing as many of these as necessary to be created.  All created instances are pushed to an array, that a final ‘buildteam’ function allows them to be neatly rendered to HTML.
